### Frequently Asked Questions ###

#### Does it work with Gutenberg and WordPress 6+?
Yes! The plugin is fully compatible with modern WordPress (5.0+) and the Gutenberg editor.

#### How do I know if the integration is working?
After submitting a test form, check your ActionNetwork action for new submissions. The plugin automatically handles retries and error logging.

#### Can I use this for non-ActionNetwork webhooks?
This plugin is specifically designed for ActionNetwork's API structure. For general webhooks, consider using [CF7 to Webhook](https://github.com/mariovalney/cf7-to-zapier).

#### How does file upload work?
File uploads are automatically handled - files are copied to a secure directory and the URLs are sent to ActionNetwork before CF7 removes the temporary files.

#### Can I customize field mapping?
Yes! Use the `actionnetwork` option in your CF7 field tags:  
`[text your-field actionnetwork:custom_field_name]`

#### What happens to CF7 emails when integration is active?
By default, CF7 emails are automatically disabled when ActionNetwork integration is configured to prevent duplicate notifications. ActionNetwork autoresponse emails can be controlled separately.

#### How does country detection work?
The plugin tries multiple methods in order:
1. GeoIP functions (if available)
2. Free ipapi.co service
3. CloudFlare country headers
4. Browser language preferences

#### Can I add multiple ActionNetwork URLs?
Yes, you can add multiple URLs (one per line) to send the same form data to different ActionNetwork actions.
